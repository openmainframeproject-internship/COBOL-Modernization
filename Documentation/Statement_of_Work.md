# Statement of Work

## Description of Project

Billions of lines of COBOL are still running the core IT of thousands of companies but those applications have largely been left out of modern advances in IT.
In this scenario, a mid-tier bank is losing business to the competition due to their inability to deliver their banking services with a contemporary user experience.
This project is meant to demonstrate the options for modernizing this existing COBOL application, and others like it, to address the business needs and prove the future possibilities.

## Current State (as of 15th Jul 2021)

Completed Tasks:

- All Technical Training
- Analysis of the Legacy Banking Application
- Creation of Business Rules
- Identification of Service Candidates

Ongoing Tasks:

- Isolating and Exposing the 4 candidates as services

Upcoming Tasks:

- Connecting the Services to New, Modern UI

## Value

The project demonstrates the options of modernising a legacy banking application, thus encouraging businesses to start and complete this long pending task so that their legacy applications can again become their assets and not stay as a liability.

Also since this project is done by a university student, it shows the task of application modernisation is not a complicated one and can be performed by professionals after little training.

The project also paves way for COBOL Modernisation to become a centre of discussion amongst educational institutions so that they can encourage more students to learn and perform it.

## Business Requirement

[Legacy banking applications are top concern for banks](https://financialeditorial.com/banking/fdic-chief-cites-legacy-systems-as-no-1-concern-for-banks/) and the best solution is modernising them.
Thus, this project holds immense value to businesses as a demo of how to perform application modernisation.
