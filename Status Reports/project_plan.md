**Student's Name: Sudhanshu Dubey**

**Mentor: Guy Sofer and Gary Evans**

**Project: COBOL Modernization**

**Project Description:**
How a Student Modernized a Legacy Banking Application
In partnership with the Open Mainframe Project, we asked student intern Sudhanshu Dubey to demonstrate the options for modernizing an existing COBOL application to address the business needs and prove the future possibilities.  He’ll start with the core application of a theoretical mid-tier bank that was losing business to the competition due to their inability to deliver banking services with a contemporary user experience. He’ll then design a modern UI, and API enable the existing COBOL application in order to deliver a fast and safe application modernization and prove that If a university student can do it, any business can too.  

**Problem Definition:**
Billions of lines of COBOL are still running the core IT of thousands of companies but those applications have largely been left out of modern advances in IT.

**Deliverables**
- A modern banking application. Web-based UI with the original COBOL code running as the backend.
- Architecture documents.
- Description of the process.
- Demo video and a blog.
