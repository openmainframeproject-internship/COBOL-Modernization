# Code for Modern User Interfaces of the Services

This directory contains code for modern UIs of different services which we have extracted from the original Bank Demo COBOL code.
These UIs are built using various technologies to demonstrate the possibilities with Application Modernisation and as such the way to deploy and use these modern UIs will differ from each other.
Detailed instructions are provided along with the UI code.
